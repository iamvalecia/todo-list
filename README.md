This project is about turning an existing todo list app, made during a JavaScript tutorial in 2018, into a better app. It currently uses HTML and vanilla JavaScript.

The starting app can be found in the initial commit.

The tutorial used to create the original app is called [Practical JavaScript](https://watchandcode.com/)


My goals for improvement are:
1. Make user experience better by:
   -	adding keyboard controls.
   -	making the edit and toggle complete selectors start from '1' instead of '0'.
2. Improve aesthetics with CSS.
3. Create back-end with either node.js or SQL.
